## The problem
A typical wedding has 30–60 single guests. Most of them spend the whole night at their assigned table, talk to two cousins, and go home. Public dating apps don't help — they're built for cities of millions, not for a one-night, ~150-person room where the awkwardness of being on Tinder *at someone's wedding* kills the use case immediately. The opportunity is obvious, the existing tooling is wrong.

## The approach
Three product decisions defined the whole thing.

First, sell to couples, not to singles. The buyer is the bride and groom — they invest 10 minutes setting up the event, share a private link, and look like heroes when their guests start matching. The singles get the product for free, in context, and inside a circle of people their friends already trust.

Second, scope every event tightly. Profiles are visible only to verified attendees of that wedding. There's no global pool, no random swipes, no exposure beyond the event. That's what makes it acceptable to put on the wedding invitation — and what makes it work product-wise.

Third, open matching *before* the wedding, not at the wedding. People show up already knowing who they want to look for on the dance floor, which collapses the awkward first-move barrier and makes the night demonstrably more fun.

## What I built
The full stack, end-to-end. iOS and Android apps for guests (profile creation, browsing, matching, chat, in-app safety tools). A host flow for couples (event setup, guest list, link generation, basic moderation). The marketing site with testimonials and quote-request flow. Privacy controls (report, block, profile-visibility scoping). Stripe-based billing for the host fee.

Designed and shipped solo: brand, mobile UI, backend, infrastructure, marketing.

## Outcome
50+ weddings hosted. 1,000+ matches generated. Real couples now dating from real weddings — including, per testimonials, one couple now engaged. Active across Mexico City, Los Cabos, Playa del Carmen, Cancún, Cuernavaca, and San Miguel de Allende, with weddings running internationally for guests flying in from multiple countries.
